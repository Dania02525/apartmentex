# Apartmentex

Easy SaaS for Phoenix/Ecto.

## NOTE: This branch will be for Ecto 2.0 +, and will be updated shortly to work with that version.  If you are
using pre-ecto 2.0, please choose the appropriate branch for your ecto version and appropriate hex package.

* Tenant-qualified queries targeting postgres schemas or MySql databases
* Automatic migrations for tenant tables to schema for Postgres or
database for MySQL

See an example app at https://github.com/Dania02525/widget_saas

### Setup

- Add this to your mix.exs deps:
```elixir
{:apartmentex, github: "Dania02525/apartmentex"}
```
- Run:
```mix deps.get && mix deps.compile```

- You can also configure your tenant schema prefix, adding this to your application configs:
```elixir
config :apartmentex, schema_prefix: "prefix_" # the default prefix is "tenant_"
```

### Use

Place tenant only migrations in a new folder in priv/repo called "tenant_migrations". These migrations should use Apartmentex.Migration, not Ecto.Migration.

You can now add a new tenant and automatically create a new schema for Postgres users or a new database for MySQL users, and run the migrations in priv/repo/tenant_migrations for that schema or database.

Table references and indexes in a migration will be applied to the same tenant prefix as the table within tenant_migrations.

```elixir
Apartmentex.new_tenant(Repo, tenant)
```

When deleting a tenant, you can also automatically drop their associated schema or database (for MySQL).

```elixir
Apartmentex.drop_tenant(Repo, tenant)
```

Include the tenant struct or tenant id in Apartmentex calls for queries, inserts, updates, and deletes.

```elixir

  widgets = Apartmentex.all(Repo, Widget, tenant)

  Apartmentex.insert(Repo, changeset, tenant)

  Apartmentex.update(Repo, changeset, tenant_id)

  Apartmentex.delete!(Repo, widget, tenant_id)

```

### To Do

- mix task to migrate or rollback all tenant schemas/databases
- tests
